# general

In this Simple project we have done the following and fulfilled the objectives:

- creating a CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins groovy syntax and Docker agents
- creating a Jenkinsfile containing our CI/CD config, requirements.txt file containing our python script dependencies (Fire libraries)
  and finally our hello.py script. 
  
- configuring our jenkins server with docker plugins to be able to have a slave socat node which would run our application.
- our slave node is running the docker/jenkins image on a socat container. we've connected to this on port 2375 after inspecting the container IP address

- pulled and cloned the contents from our git repo
- have done both pipeline script and pipline script from SCM(git)
